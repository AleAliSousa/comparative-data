Legend:
Figure 2. The volume of each functional area varies as a simple shared function of the number of neurons in each area, with the exception of the visual areas. Top left, area volume plotted as a function of the average number of neurons found in that functional area. The fitted line is the linear function that describes the entire dataset, including areas V1, V2L, and V2M, whose respective datapoints fall well outside of the 95% confidence interval (dotted lines). Top right, variation in average neuronal density (neurons/mm3) across functional areas. Gray levels represent neuronal density normalized by the maximal value, observed in area V1 (100%, that is, black). Bottom, variation in neuronal density across functional areas and across individuals. Horizontal lines indicate the average neuronal density found in each functional area.
