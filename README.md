# Comparative data

This is a repository of comparative data useful for neuroanatomy and neuroscience more generally.

## How to contribute

If you find tabular data as a picture, you can use http://www.onlineocr.net/ to convert it to text. Another alternatives are http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/ or using the Naphta extension for Chrome https://projectnaptha.com/.

For data in scatter plots, bar plots and others, you can use http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/.

For each data table, create a file where the name is the DOI of the paper where the data comes from. DOI codes have symbols that are not allowed in a file name. Convert them to an acceptable name using http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/.

Put a correctly formated `.tsv` file with the data (GitHub will let you know if there are any problems), and add further comments or legends in a file with the same name plus `.ReadMe.txt`.

Finaly, to enjoy the fruit of your work, you can use http://rawgraphs.io/ and pass a https://rawgit.com link to the `.tsv` file to get beautiful d3 plots.
